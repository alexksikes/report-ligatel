Fixes a couple of bugs. 

Log every query performed on the CGI interface.

Adds the following options to the command line version (and CGI interface):

-a, --aggregate [field_1,...,field_n] : aggregate on certain fields
                                        (customer, place, reseller, did, plan_name,
                                        date (by month), status, invoice_status,
                                        transaction_type)
-b, --billing [country,day_num]       : the cash invoices are created manually
                                        specify a billing day for a specific country
                                        (eg day/01/2007 (included) --- day-1/02/2007 (included))
                                        default is 28
--sort [field_1,...,field_n]          : sort by date, customer, reseller ...
--column [field_1,...,field_n]        : show only certain columns
